# SEP CoffeePoint Corporation Challenge

## Backstory

You are a black hat hacker, recently contracted by **Coffee King** to help them pull ahead of their long-time rival, **CoffeePoint Corporation**. As the world leader in holiday themed coffee beverages, CoffeePoint's annual "red cup" drink specials always dominate the marketplace. However, all that could change if you are successful.  

## Target
Your client has provided one IP address as your target: 
> 10.10.45.5

**Coffee King** has provided a list of flags they need you to obtain:
1. The database archive password, stored somewhere in /var/www
2. The webmaster's social security number, which might be located in his Documents folder
3. The secret holiday drink recipe, somewhere in a user's account.
4. CoffeePoint's unreleased quarterly earnings.

Good hunting!
