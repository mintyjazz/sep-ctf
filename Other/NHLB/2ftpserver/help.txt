CoffeePoint FTP Server

Secure files are stored on this server, but are hidden from view until the correct key.txt is provided.

The key.txt format is "secure_code=XXX"

The server routinely checks for submission of an accurate key.txt file and will reveal what you are looking for when the correct code is uploaded.
